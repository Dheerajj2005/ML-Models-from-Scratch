# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models built from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to deepen understanding of these models by implementing them without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.

## Implemented Models

* **Linear Regression:**
  * Simple Linear Regression
  * Multiple Linear Regression
* **Optimization Algorithm**
  * Gradient Descent
  * Batch Gradient Descent
  * Stochastic Gradient Descent
  * Mini Batch Gradient Descent 

## Features

* **Clear and concise code:** The code is well-documented and easy to understand.
* **NumPy-based:** The implementations primarily use NumPy for numerical computations, avoiding dependencies on high-level libraries.
* **Test cases:** Each model includes test cases to ensure correctness.
* **Explanations:** Detailed explanations of the algorithms and their implementation are provided.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find any bugs or want to add new models or features, feel free to submit a pull request.
