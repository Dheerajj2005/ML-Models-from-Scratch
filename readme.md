#  Machine Learning Algorithms — From Scratch & Scikit-learn

This repository provides a **comprehensive end-to-end implementation of core Machine Learning algorithms** — both **from scratch (mathematical + coding implementation)** and using **Scikit-learn** for comparison.  

It covers everything from **data preprocessing**, **regression**, **classification**, to **tree-based ensemble models**, all designed to help understand **how algorithms work under the hood** — not just how to use them.

##  Project Overview

This project aims to **bridge the gap between ML theory and implementation**.  
Each notebook demonstrates:
- How the algorithm works internally (step-by-step mathematical breakdown)
- How to implement it from scratch in Python
- How to use the same algorithm via Scikit-learn
- A side-by-side comparison of both models (performance + visualization)

Whether you’re a **beginner learning the math behind ML** or an **intermediate developer mastering model internals**, this project provides a clear, structured, and practical guide.


## 📈 Key Highlights

✅ **From Scratch Implementations** — understand model internals (math, loss functions, gradients)  
✅ **Visualization-Focused** — every model ends with decision boundaries, feature impact plots, or evaluation metrics  
✅ **Comparative Approach** — Scratch vs. Scikit-learn performance comparison for intuition  
✅ **Clean, Modular Code** — reusable functions for clarity and scalability  
✅ **Beginner-to-Advanced Flow** — starts simple (linear models) and progresses to complex ensemble methods
